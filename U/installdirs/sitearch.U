?S:sitearch:
?S:	This variable contains the eventual value of the SITEARCH symbol,
?S:	which is the name of the private library for this package.  It may
?S:	have a ~ on the front. It is up to the makefile to eventually create
?S:	this directory while performing installation (with ~ substitution).
?S:	The standard distribution will put nothing in this directory.
?S:	After perl has been installed, users may install their own local
?S:	architecture-dependent modules in this directory with
?S:		MakeMaker Makefile.PL
?S:	or equivalent.  See INSTALL for details.

?D:sitearchexp=''
?S:sitearchexp:
?S:	This variable is the ~name expanded version of sitearch, so that you
?S:	may use it directly in Makefiles or shell scripts.

?D:installsitearch=''
?S:installsitearch:
?S:	This variable is really the same as sitearchexp but may differ on
?S:	those systems using AFS. For extra portability, only this variable
?S:	should be used in makefiles.
?S:.
?D:d_sitearch=''
?S:d_sitearch:
?S:	This variable conditionally defines SITEARCH to hold the pathname
?S:	of architecture-dependent library files for $package.  If
?S:	$sitearch is the same as $archlib, then this is set to undef.
?S:.
?C:SITEARCH:
?C:	This symbol contains the name of the private library for this package.
?C:	The library is private in the sense that it needn't be in anyone's
?C:	execution path, but it should be accessible by the world.  The program
?C:	should be prepared to do ~ expansion.
?C:	The standard distribution will put nothing in this directory.
?C:	After perl has been installed, users may install their own local
?C:	architecture-dependent modules in this directory with
?C:		MakeMaker Makefile.PL
?C:	or equivalent.  See INSTALL for details.

?C:SITEARCH_EXP:
?C:	This symbol contains the ~name expanded version of SITEARCH, to be used
?C:	in programs that are not prepared to deal with ~ expansion at run-time.
