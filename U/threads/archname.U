?S:archname:
?S:	This variable is a short name to characterize the current
?S:	architecture.  It is used mainly to construct the default archlib.
?S:.
?S:myarchname:
?S:	This variable holds the architecture name computed by Configure in
?S:	a previous run. It is not intended to be perused by any user and
?S:	should never be set in a hint file.
?S:.
?S:useversionedarchname:
?S:	This variable indicates whether to include the $api_versionstring
?S:	as a component of the $archname.
?S:.
?C:ARCHNAME:
?C:	This symbol holds a string representing the architecture name.
?C:	It may be used to construct an architecture-dependant pathname
?C:	where library files may be held under a private library, for
?C:	instance.

?X: We always recompute archname in case osname changes. However, we need
?X: to be careful since, as ADO rightfully pointed out, some systems pick
?X: silly architecture names (0001307135000-aix on AIX or 9000/715-ux under
?X: HP-UX). Therefore, we allow hint files to superseed our guess and ask
?X: the user for confirmation.
