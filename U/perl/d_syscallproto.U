?S:d_syscallproto:
?S:	This variable conditionally defines the HAS_SYSCALL_PROTO symbol,
?S:	which indicates to the C program that the system provides
?S:	a prototype for the syscall() function.  Otherwise, it is
?S:	up to the program to supply one.

?C:HAS_SYSCALL_PROTO:
?C:	This symbol, if defined, indicates that the system provides
?C:	a prototype for the syscall() function.  Otherwise, it is up
?C:	to the program to supply one.  Good guesses are
?C:		extern int syscall(int,  ...);
