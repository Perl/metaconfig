[This Glossary is automatically generated from the Unit files.  Do not edit
this file or your changes will be lost.  Edit the appropriate Unit instead.]

This file contains a listing of all the C preprocessor symbols and shell
variables whose value can be determined by a Configure script.  For the
most part, any symbol in UPPERCASE is a C preprocessor symbol, and
will be defined in config.h.  Symbols in lowercase are shell variables,
and are defined in config.sh.

If you write your shell scripts and C programs in terms of these symbols,
metaconfig can automatically build you a Configure script that will determine
the value of those symbols.  See the README file for a description of how
to use metaconfig.

In the following listing, the Unit: line indicates the name of the unit
where this symbol is defined, and the Wants: line indicates what other
symbols must be determined in order to figure out the value of this one.
If there is an "(Also defines ...)" entry, it indicates what other symbols
are defined by the Unit other than the one corresponding to the unit name.

Variable of the form d_* either have the value "define" or "/*define", and
control whether some C preprocessor symbol gets defined or not.

	Wants: Csym Myread Typedef i_systimes

	This symbol holds the type returned by times(). It can be long,

	Unit: d_dosuid (Also defines d_suidsafe)
	Wants: cat contains ls rm test Myread Setvar Oldconfig Guess package
	  hint

	This symbol, if defined, indicates that the C program should
	check the script that it is executing for setuid/setgid bits, and
	attempt to emulate setuid/setgid on systems that have disabled
	setuid #! scripts because the kernel can't do it securely.
	It is up to the package designer to make sure that this emulation
	is done securely.  Among other things, it should do an fstat on
	the script it just opened to make sure it really is a setuid/setgid
	script, it should make sure the arguments passed correspond exactly
	to the argument on the #! line, and it should not trust any
	subprocesses to which it must pass the filename rather than the
	file descriptor of the script to be executed.

	Optional: cc ccflags libs

	This symbol, if defined, indicates that EOF condition will be detected
	by the reader of the pipe when it is closed by the writing process.

	Unit: Guess (Also defines d_eunice d_xenix d_bsd d_linux d_dos d_os2)
	Wants: cat test echo n c contains rm tr Loc eunicefix

	This symbol, if defined, indicates that the program is being compiled
	under the EUNICE package under VMS.  The program will need to handle
	things like files that don't go away the first time you unlink them,
	due to version numbering.  It will also need to compensate for lack
	of a respectable link() command.

Gconvert:
	Unit: d_gconvert (Also defines d_Gconvert)
	Wants: cat cc ccflags ldflags libs Inlibc rm _o

	This preprocessor macro is defined to convert a floating point
	number to a string without a trailing decimal point.  This
	emulates the behavior of sprintf("%g"), but is sometimes much more
	efficient.  If gconvert() is not available, but gcvt() drops the
	trailing decimal point, then gcvt() is used.  If all else fails,
	a macro using sprintf("%g") is used. Arguments for the Gconvert
	macro are: value, number of digits, whether trailing zeros should
	be retained, and the output buffer.
	Possible values are:
		d_Gconvert='gconvert((x),(n),(t),(b))'
		d_Gconvert='gcvt((x),(n),(b))'
		d_Gconvert='sprintf((b),"%.*g",(n),(x))'
	The last two assume trailing zeros should not be kept.

Gid_t:
	Unit: gidtype
	Wants: Myread Typedef Findhdr

	This symbol holds the return type of getgid() and the type of
	argument to setrgid() and related functions.  Typically,
	it is the type of group ids in the kernel. It can be int, ushort,

	Wants: gidtype d_getgrps Myread Oldconfig Findhdr cat d_setgrps

	This symbol holds the type used for the second argument to
	getgroups() and setgroups().  Usually, this is the same as
	gidtype (gid_t) , but sometimes it isn't.
	It can be int, ushort, gid_t, etc... 
	It may be necessary to include <sys/types.h> to get any 
	typedef'ed information.  This is only required if you have
	getgroups() or setgroups()..

HASATTRIBUTE:

SIGNAL_T:
	Obsoleted by Signal_t.

SIGNEDCHAR:
	Unit: d_sgndchr
	Wants: cat rm Setvar
	Optional: cc ccflags

	This symbol, if defined, indicates that characters are a signed type.

	use of negative values) should probably be declared as shorts instead.

SIGSETMASK:
	Obsoleted by HAS_SIGSETMASK.

SIGVEC:
	Obsoleted by HAS_SIGVEC.

SIGVECTOR:
	Obsoleted by HAS_SIGVECTOR.

SIG_COUNT:

	This variable contains a number larger than the largest
	signal number.  This is usually the same as the NSIG macro.

SIG_NAME:
	Unit: sig_name (Also defines sig_name_init sig_num sig_num_init
	  sig_count sig_size)
	Wants: awk Signal Oldconfig rm

	This symbol contains a list of signal names in order of
	signal number. This is intended
	to be used as a static array initialization, like this:
		char *sig_name[] = { SIG_NAME };
	The signals in the list are separated with commas, and each signal
	is surrounded by double quotes. There is no leading SIG in the signal
	name, i.e. SIGQUIT is known as "QUIT".
	Gaps in the signal numbers (up to NSIG) are filled in with NUMnn,
	etc., where nn is the actual signal number (e.g. NUM37).
	The signal number for sig_name[i] is stored in sig_num[i].
	The last element is 0 to terminate the list with a NULL.  This
	corresponds to the 0 at the end of the sig_num list.

SIG_NUM:
	Unit: sig_name (Also defines sig_name_init sig_num sig_num_init
	  sig_count sig_size)
	Wants: awk Signal Oldconfig rm

	This symbol contains a list of signal numbers, in the same order as the
	SIG_NAME list. It is suitable for static array initialization, as in:
		int sig_num[] = { SIG_NUM };
	The signals in the list are separated with commas, and the indices
	within that list and the SIG_NAME list match, so it's easy to compute
	the signal name from a number or vice versa at the price of a small
	dynamic linear lookup. 
	Duplicates are allowed, but are moved to the end of the list.
	The signal number corresponding to sig_name[i] is sig_number[i].
	if (i < NSIG) then sig_number[i] == i.  
	The last element is 0, corresponding to the 0 at the end of
	the sig_name list.

SIG_SIZE:
	Unit: sig_name (Also defines sig_name_init sig_num sig_num_init
	  sig_count sig_size)

	The standard distribution will put nothing in this directory.
	Individual sites may place their own extensions and modules in

	Individual sites may place their own extensions and modules in
	this directory.

SITELIB_EXP:
	Unit: sitelib (Also defines sitelibexp installsitelib)
	Wants: afs cat Getfile Oldconfig Prefixit test privlib package sed

	Obsoleted by SPEED_OVER_MEM.

SPEED_OVER_MEM:
	Unit: d_speedopt
	Wants: Myread Cppsym Oldconfig cat models Setvar

	Unit: ssizetype
	Wants: Myread Typedef sizetype cat rm _o
	Optional: cc optimize ccflags ldflags libs

	This symbol holds the type used by functions that return
	a count of bytes or an error condition.  It must be a signed type.
	It is usually ssize_t, but may be long or int, etc.

	to get any typedef'ed information.
	We will pick a type such that sizeof(SSize_t) == sizeof(Size_t).

STARTPERL:
	Unit: startperl
	Wants: cat rm sharpbang perlpath d_portable Myread

	This symbol is the string that should be put on the front of a
	perl script to make sure (hopefully) that it runs with perl and
	not under some shell. That line should be followed by the classical
	invocation magic:
		eval 'exec perl -S $0 ${1+"$@"}'
			if $running_under_some_shell;
	to guarantee perl startup should the shell execute the script at first.

	Unit: d_tminsys
	Wants: contains Setvar Findhdr

	This symbol is defined if this system declares "struct tm" in
	<sys/time.h> rather than <time.h>.  We can't just say

	Wants: cat contains cppstdin cppminus rm Setvar Findhdr
	Optional: cppflags

	This symbol if defined indicates to the C program that the first argument
	for the wait3() system call should be declared as 'union wait status'
	instead of 'int status'. You probably need to include <sys/wait.h>

	Wants: cat rm Inlibc Guess Setvar i_unistd
	Optional: cc libs ccflags ldflags

	This symbol, if defined, indicates that setpgrp needs two
	arguments whereas USG one needs none.  See also HAS_SETPGID
	for a POSIX interface.

USE_CHAR_VSPRINTF:
	Unit: d_vprintf (Also defines d_charvspr)
	Wants: Guess cat Csym Setvar
	Optional: cc ccflags

	This symbol is defined if this system has vsprintf() returning type
	(char*).  The trend seems to be to declare it as "int vsprintf()".  It
	is up to the package author to declare vsprintf correctly based on the
	symbol.

USE_CROSS_COMPILE:
	Unit: Cross (Also defines run to from targetarch usecrosscompile)

	This symbol if defined indicates to the C program that inetd will be
	in charge of the initial socket connection. The file descriptors 0 and
	1 have been dup()ed from the original connected socket descriptor and
	are ready for send() and recv().

USE_LINUX_STDIO:
	Unit: d_linuxstd
	Wants: d_stdstdio cppstdin cppflags cppminus contains rm Setvar
	  Findhdr

	This symbol is defined if this system has a FILE structure declaring

USE_OLDSOCKET:
	Unit: d_socket (Also defines d_oldsock d_sockpair socketlib sockethdr)
	Wants: contains libc echo n c nm_opt nm_extract Inlibc Csym _a

	This symbol, if defined, indicates that the 4.1c BSD socket interface
	is supported instead of the 4.2/4.3 BSD socket interface. For instance,
	there is no setsockopt() call.

USE_SOCKS:
	Unit: usesocks
	Wants: Myread Oldconfig Setvar spackage package

	This symbol, if defined, indicates that Perl should
	be built to use socks.

USE_STAT_BLOCKS:
	Unit: d_statblks
	Wants: contains Setvar Findhdr

	This symbol is defined if this system has a stat structure declaring
	st_blksize and st_blocks.

USE_STDIO_BASE:
	Unit: d_stdstdio (Also defines d_stdiobase stdio_ptr stdio_cnt
	  stdio_base stdio_bufsiz d_stdio_cnt_lval d_stdio_ptr_lval
	  stdio_filbuf)

	Optional: cc ccflags ldflags libs

	This symbol is defined if the _base field (or similar) of the
	stdio FILE structure can be used to access the stdio buffer for
	a file handle.  If this is defined, then the FILE_base(fp) macro
	will also be defined and should be used to access this field.
	Also, the FILE_bufsiz(fp) macro will be defined and should be used
	to determine the number of bytes in the buffer.  USE_STDIO_BASE
	will never be defined unless USE_STDIO_PTR is.

USE_STDIO_PTR:
	Unit: d_stdstdio (Also defines d_stdiobase stdio_ptr stdio_cnt
	  stdio_base stdio_bufsiz d_stdio_cnt_lval d_stdio_ptr_lval
	  stdio_filbuf)
	Wants: cat contains rm Setvar Findhdr Oldconfig
	Optional: cc ccflags ldflags libs

	This symbol is defined if the _ptr and _cnt fields (or similar)
	of the stdio FILE structure can be used to access the stdio buffer
	for a file handle.  If this is defined, then the FILE_ptr(fp)
	and FILE_cnt(fp) macros will also be defined and should be used
	to access these fields.

USE_STD_STDIO:
	Obsoleted by USE_STDIO_PTR.

USE_STRUCT_COPY:
	Unit: d_strctcpy
	Wants: cat rm cc Setvar

	This symbol, if defined, indicates that this C compiler knows how
	to copy structures.  If undefined, you'll need to use a block copy
	routine of some sort instead.

USE_SYS_TIME_H:
	Obsoleted by I_SYS_TIME.

USE_TIME_H:
	Obsoleted by I_TIME.

USE_TIOCNOTTY:
	Unit: i_sysioctl (Also defines i_bsdioctl i_sysfilio i_syssockio
	  d_voidtty)

	  Inhdr
	Optional: cc

	This symbol, if defined indicate to the C program that the ioctl()
	call with TIOCNOTTY should be used to void tty association.
	Otherwise (on USG probably), it is enough to close the standard file
	decriptors and do a setpgrp().

USE_WIFSTAT:
	Unit: d_wifstat
	Wants: d_uwait Oldconfig cat rm
	Optional: cc ccflags ldflags libs

	This symbol, if defined, indicates to the C program that the argument
	for the WIFxxx set of macros such as WIFSIGNALED or WIFEXITED can
	be of the same kind as the one used to hold the wait() status. Should
	only matter on HP-UX, where the macros are incorrectly written and
	therefore cause programs using them with an 'union wait' variable
	to not compile properly. See also UNION_WAIT.

USGNAMES:
	Unit: nametype (Also defines d_passnames d_berknames d_usgnames)
	Wants: Myread Guess Oldconfig cat

	This symbol, if defined, indicates that full names are stored in
	the /etc/passwd file in USG format (everything after - and before ( is
	the name).

USLEEP:
	Obsoleted by HAS_USLEEP.

Uid_t:
	Unit: uidtype
	Wants: Myread Typedef Findhdr

	This symbol holds the type used to declare user ids in the kernel.

	present on the non-blocking file descriptor.

VAL_NOFILE:
	Unit: d_NOFILE (Also defines nofile d_gettblsz tablesize)
	Wants: Myread Guess cat test rm Csym
	Optional: cc ccflags libs

	This symbol contains the number of file descriptors available to the
	process, as determined at configuration time. Unless a static constant
	is needed, you should rely on getdtablesize() to obtain that number.

VAL_O_NONBLOCK:
	Unit: nblock_io (Also defines o_nonblock eagain rd_nodata d_eofnblk)
	Wants: cat rm d_open3 h_sysfile h_fcntl signal_t hint Oldconfig
	  Setvar startsh Warn
	Optional: cc ccflags ldflags

	This symbol is to be used during open() or fcntl(F_SETFL) to turn on
	non-blocking I/O for the file descriptor. Note that there is no way
	back, i.e. you cannot turn it blocking again this way. If you wish to
	alternatively switch between blocking and non-blocking, use the
	ioctl(FIOSNBIO) call instead, but that is not supported by all devices.

VFORK:
	Obsoleted by HAS_VFORK.

VMS:
	Obsoleted by VMS_SYSTEM.

VMS_SYSTEM:
	Unit: Guess (Also defines d_eunice d_xenix d_bsd d_linux d_dos d_os2)
	Wants: cat test echo n c contains rm tr Loc eunicefix

	This symbol, if defined, indicates that the program is running under
	VMS.  It is currently only set in conjunction with the EUNICE symbol.

VOIDFLAGS:
	Unit: voidflags (Also defines defvoidused)
	Wants: cat sed rm contains package Oldconfig Myread
	Optional: cc ccflags

	This symbol indicates how much support of the void type is given by this
	compiler.  What various bits mean:
	
	    1 = supports declaration of void
	    2 = supports arrays of pointers to functions returning void
	    4 = supports comparisons between pointers to void functions and
		    addresses of void functions
	    8 = suports declaration of generic void pointers
	
	The package designer should define VOIDUSED to indicate the requirements
	of the package.  This can be done either by #defining VOIDUSED before
	including config.h, or by defining defvoidused in Myinit.U.  If the
	latter approach is taken, only those flags will be tested.  If the
	level of void support necessary is not present, defines void to int.

VOIDSIG:
	Unit: d_voidsig (Also defines signal_t)
	Wants: rm contains cppstdin cppminus test Myread Oldconfig Setvar
	  Findhdr
	Optional: cppflags

	This symbol is defined if this system declares "void (*signal(...))()" in
	signal.h.  The old way was to declare it as "int (*signal(...))()".  It
	is up to the package author to declare things correctly based on the
	symbol.

VOIDTTY:
	Obsoleted by USE_TIOCNOTTY.

VOID_CLOSEDIR:
	Unit: d_closedir (Also defines d_void_closedir)
	Wants: Inlibc i_dirent i_sysdir i_sysndir cc ccflags ldflags libs

	does not return a value.

VPRINTF:
	Obsoleted by HAS_VPRINTF.

V_FUNC:
	Unit: prototype
	Wants: Myread Oldconfig cat rm Setvar
	Optional: cc ccflags

	This macro is used to declare "public" (non-static) functions.
	It takes three arguments: the function type and name, a parenthesized
	traditional (comma separated) argument list, and the declared argument
	list (in which arguments are separated with NXT_ARG, and additional
	arbitrary arguments are specified with DOTS).  For example:
	
		V_FUNC(int main, (argc, argv), int argc NXT_ARG char *argv[])

V_FUNC_VOID:
	Unit: prototype
	Wants: Myread Oldconfig cat rm Setvar
	Optional: cc ccflags

	This macro is used to declare "public" (non-static) functions that have
	no arguments.  The macro takes one argument: the function type and name.
	For example:

WAIT4:
	Obsoleted by HAS_WAIT4.

WAITPID:
	Obsoleted by HAS_WAITPID.

	Xenix (at least 3.0 ?).

_:
	Unit: prototype
	Wants: Myread Oldconfig cat rm Setvar
	Optional: cc ccflags

	This macro is used to declare function parameters for folks who want
	to make declarations with prototypes using a different style than
	the above macros.  Use double parentheses.  For example:
	
		int main _((int argc, char *argv[]));

_V:
	Unit: vaproto
	Wants: prototype i_stdarg Setvar

	This macro is used to declare function parameters in prototypes for
	functions with a variable number of parameters. Use double parentheses.
	For example:
	
		int printf _V((char *fmt, ...));
	
	Remember to use the plain simple _() macro when declaring a function
	with no variable number of arguments, since it might be possible to
	have a non-effect _V() macro and still get prototypes via _().

_a:
	Unit: Unix (Also defines _a _o firstmakefile archobjs)
	Wants: Oldconfig

	This variable defines the extension used for ordinary libraries.

	Wants: newslib Oldconfig Getfile

	This is the same as the active variable, but is filename expanded
	so that later Configure units can look at the active file if desired.

afs:
	Unit: afs (Also defines afsroot)
	Wants: test

	This variable is set to 'true' if AFS (Andrew File System) is used
	on the system, 'false' otherwise.  It is possible to override this
	with a hint value or command line option, but you'd better know
	what you are doing.

afsroot:
	Unit: afs (Also defines afsroot)
	Wants: test

	This variable is by default set to '/afs'. In the unlikely case
	this is not the correct root, it is possible to override this with

	  Myread Guess Oldconfig Csym
	Optional: i_whoami usrinc

	Thie variable contains the command which can be used to compute the
	host name. The command is fully qualified by its absolute path, to make
	it safe when used by a process with super-user privileges.

archlib:
	Unit: archlib (Also defines d_archlib archlibexp installarchlib)
	Wants: archname afs spackage cat Getfile Loc Oldconfig prefixexp
	  privlib test Prefixit Prefixup

	This variable holds the name of the directory in which the user wants
	to put architecture-dependent public library files for $package.
	It is most often a local directory such as /usr/local/lib.
	Programs using this variable must be prepared to deal 
	with filename expansion.

	filename expanded at configuration time, for convenient use.

archname:
	Unit: archname (Also defines myarchname)
	Wants: sed Loc Myread Oldconfig osname test rm

	This variable is a short name to characterize the current

archobjs:
	Unit: Unix (Also defines _a _o firstmakefile archobjs)
	Wants: Oldconfig

	This variable defines any additional objects that must be linked
	in with the program on this architecture.  On unix, it is usually

	Wants: Null

	The base revision level of this package, from the .package file.

basicshell:
	Unit: basicshell
	Wants: Getfile Oldconfig bash csh ksh sh

	This variable holds the byte order. In the following, larger digits
	indicate more significance.  The variable byteorder is either 4321
	on a big-endian machine, or 1234 on a little-endian, or 87654321
	on a Cray ... or 3412 with weird order !

bzero:
	Magic symbol, needs: HAS_BZERO
	Unit: d_bzero
	Wants: Inlibc

	the user.  It is up to the Makefile to use this.

ccname:
	Unit: Checkcc (Also defines ccname ccversion)
	Wants: Myread Warn startsh cat contains test

	This can set either by hints files or by Configure.  If using
	gcc, this is gcc, and if not, usually equal to cc, unimpressive, no?
	Some platforms, however, make good use of this by storing the
	flavor of the C compiler being used here.  For example if using
	the Sun WorkShop suite, ccname will be 'workshop'.

ccsymbols:
	Unit: Cppsym (Also defines ccsymbols cppsymbols cppccsymbols)
	Wants: run eunicefix Guess awk cat tr sed sort rm startsh osname
	  gccversion test comm uniq echo Options trnl optimize ccflags

ccversion:
	Unit: Checkcc (Also defines ccname ccversion)
	Wants: Myread Warn startsh cat contains test

cf_name:
	Unit: cf_name (With private cf_name)
	Wants: cf_by passcat Filexp nametype cat test

	Full name of the person who ran the Configure script and answered the

cf_time:
	Unit: cf_who (Also defines cf_time cf_by)
	Wants: date Oldconfig

	Obsoleted by chorder_int.

charsize:
	Unit: charsize
	Wants: cat rm Myread
	Optional: cc ccflags

	This variable contains the value of the CHARSIZE symbol, which
	indicates to the C program how many bytes there are in a character.

chorder_int:
	Unit: charorder (Also defines chorder_int chorder_short chorder_long)
	Wants: Myread cat rm
	Optional: cc ccflags

	Holds the value describing the byte ordering of characters in an int.
	For instance, on a Big-Endian machine, this would be: "c0c1c2c3".

chorder_long:
	Unit: charorder (Also defines chorder_int chorder_short chorder_long)
	Wants: Myread cat rm
	Optional: cc ccflags

	Holds the value describing the byte ordering of characters in a long.
	On a 64 bits Big-Endian machine, that would yield: "c0c1c2c3c4c5c6c7".

chorder_short:
	Unit: charorder (Also defines chorder_int chorder_short chorder_long)
	Wants: Myread cat rm
	Optional: cc ccflags

	Holds the value describing the byte ordering of characters in a short.
	On a Big-Endian machine, that would be "c0c1".

	  cntrydist contdist)
	Wants: test newslibexp cat Myread Oldconfig

	This variable contains the eventual value of the CNTRYDIST symbol,

compile:
	Unit: Compile
	Optional: cc optimize ccflags ldflags libs

	This shell variable is used internally by Configure to provide
	a convenient shorthand for the typical compile command, namely
	$cc $optimize $ccflags $ldflags -o $1 $1.c $libs > /dev/null 2>&1
	Note that the output filename does _not_ include the _exe
	extension.  Instead we assume that the linker will be
	"helpful" and automatically appending the correct suffix.
	OS/2 users will apparently need to supply the -Zexe flag to
	get this behavior.
	
	To use this variable, say something like:
		echo 'int main() { exit(0); }' > try.c
		set try
		if eval $compile; then
			echo "success"   # and do whatever . . . 
		else
			echo "failure"   # and do whatever . . . 
		fi
	To add extra flags cc flags (e.g. -DWHATEVER) just put them
	in $*, e.g.
		set try -DTRY_THIS_FLAG

compile_ok:
	Unit: Compile
	Optional: cc optimize ccflags ldflags libs

	This shell variable is used internally by Configure to provide
	a convenient shorthand for the typical compile command that you
	expect to work ok.  It is the same as $compile, except we
	deliberately let the user see any error messages. 

contains:
	Unit: contains
	Wants: Nothing

	This variable holds the command to do a grep with a proper return
	status.  On most sane systems it is simply "grep".  On insane systems
	it is a grep followed by a cat followed by a test.  This variable
	is primarily for the use of other Configure units.

contdist:
	Unit: locdist (Also defines orgdist citydist statedist multistatedist
	  cntrydist contdist)
	Wants: test newslibexp cat Myread Oldconfig

	This variable contains the eventual value of the CONTDIST symbol,
	which is the continent's distribution name for news.

cpp_quote:
	Unit: cpp_stuff (Also defines cpp_quote)
	Wants: cat contains cppstdin cppflags cppminus rm Warn package

	This variable is set to either '"' or '' depending on whether the
	pre-processor pre-dates ANSI or not.  It is used in the production of
	the SQuoTe() and EQuoTe() macros, and was introduced to overcome a bug
	in gcc 3.x whereby the pre-processor complained loudly about the
	unterminated strings.

cpp_stuff:
	Unit: cpp_stuff (Also defines cpp_quote)
	Wants: cat contains cppstdin cppflags cppminus rm Warn package

	This variable contains an identification of the catenation mechanism
	used by the C preprocessor.

cpp_trad:
	Unit: cpp_trad
	Wants: cpp cat contains rm

	This variable contains the program to run to get traditional C
	preprocessor semantics and not ISO C semantics: we want something
	that knows as little about C as possible to use as a more general

		set header i_header [ header2 i_header2 ... ]
		eval $inhdr
	That will print a message, saying wether header was found or
	not and set i_header* accordingly. If the first header is not
